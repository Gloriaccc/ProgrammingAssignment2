## The overall function below is to cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(Solve) m <<- Solve
  getSolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been 
## calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with 
## the solve function in R.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- Solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(m)
  m
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
